# To create a table of unique skills and assign IDs. For use as lookup table in Project_3 schema.
# Original table listed skills by job_posting_ID as VERY long strings of skills separated by commas

# This codes parses that list of skills for each posting and creates a normalized table 
# to be linked back to job posting by a new skill_id key

# Also creates df_skills_melt, which retains the position # of each skill in each job posting: Fares
# wanted to look at these patterns

# to export: tbl_skills_master, tmp_tbl_skills_w_count for validations, df_skills_melt (stores position of each skill in each posting)
